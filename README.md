# The-Trapped-Knight
Julia project written in Jupyter to simulate the process outlined in the trapped knight math puzzle.
The process creates a "board" of spiraling numbers from the center. Then takes a knight chess piece starting at the center of the board. The knight then moves to the smallest position on the board that has not been visited until it gets stuck at the number 2084.
